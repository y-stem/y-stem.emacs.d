  - Download ob-prolog and put it in a directory somewhere.
  - Add the following to your .emacs file
  - (or use melpa)

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ob-prolog-dir")
  #+END_SRC

 You also need to add the next snippet or add =(prolog . t)= to
 languages org-babel can load:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((prolog . t)))
  #+END_SRC

  You can then execute the query by pressing =C-c C-c= on the
  source-block header.
